# Unsupervised-ML-Myopia-Clusters

In this assignment, you’ll apply what you learned about unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization that shares your findings.

## Background

You are on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Your team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

You have been provided with raw data, so you’ll first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. You will use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.

Recommendation : It is inconclusive to determine if the patients can be clustered into whether they have or does not have myopia.There were 618 samples with 14 variables. After scaling the data and reducing the dimensions, the pca was reduced to 618 sample with 2 components. If additional dimensions were added, the data would likely allow us to show some clusters and determine the outcome.
